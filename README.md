# Combinational_lock_code

Verilog HDL code for combinational lock on FPGA.

## Verilog implementation of the combinational lock on FPGA plate

Here we will describe the realization of combinational lock on Verilog hardware description language (HDL). These Verilog HDL files will describe the system architecture of the combinational lock. 

We will write each Verilog HDL module in its own file for simplicity of reading and debugging the code.

The final project will contain this list of Verilog HDL files:
- anode_control.v		
- bcd_control.v			
- bcd_to_cathodes.v		
- button_debouncer.v	
- clock_divider.v		
- data_saver.v          
- increase_digit.v		
- refresh_counter.v		
- shift_anode.v			
- show_manager.v		
- state_indicator.v     
- state_manager.v       
- top.v					

Next, we will describe the purpose and action of each of these files. The order of files will be from abstract to more concrete.

### state_manager.v

Since in the combinational lock we need to have an ability to enter data, password, etc., we need to have several different states in which the board will perform different functions. In common programming languages, we could make several consecutive calls to the corresponding functions wrapped in `while(true)`, but in Verilog HDL we describe the architecture of the system, so "function calls" cannot be executed here. We conclude that we must somehow tell the system when to do certain actions. The `state` register can help us with this, which will tell other parts of the system what to do now. 

To control register `state`, we will create a module `state_manager`. This module synchronizes other parts of the system by the variable `state`, describes what state will be next, and under what conditions state will change. 

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `button_next` is used to move to the next stage if conditions are satisfactory.

Inputs `digitX_showing` (entered passcode) and `digitX_password` are used on the passcode check stage.

Output `state` is a register, that synchronizes other parts of the program.

#### How does it work

The module has `always` block which is executed every time `button_next` is clicked. Code inside `always` block selects next state and change variable `state`. At state 3, the correctness of the entered passcode is additionally checked.  If it is not correct, the `state` is not changed.

### data_saver.v

We need to memorize data and password, therefore we create module `data_saver` which will do this. 

This module will allow us to save registers from some inputs. We will save there passcode and data.

#### Inputs and outputs 

Input `state` is used to check if the module now should save data.

Input `state_save` is a parameter, which denotes the state on which we should save data.

Inputs `digitX_insertdata` are wires for digits, which we want to save.

Outputs `digitX_data` are registers where saved values from input digits will be stored.

#### How does it work

In the `always` block it check `state` and if it equal to `save_state`, it saves input digits to registers.

### show_manager.v

Since we want to display different data from different registers (e.g. input data or saved data) on the same display, but segments on LED are just wires, each of which could be connected only to one register, we need to have some registers which will be "unite" those different registers, that is, equate to registers when their time teaches. We will perform the switch of the "unite" register in the module `show_manager`. 

This module selects, according to the state, a pack of digits with `position_pointer` which will be displayed on LED among different packs.

#### Inputs and outputs 

Input `state` is needed to select actual digits.

Input `button_increase` is used to update digits when some of them increased.

Inputs `position_pointer_insertdata`, `position_pointer_insertnewpass` and `position_pointer_insertpass` are pointers for states of insertion data, creation passcode and insertation passcode accordingly.

Inputs `digitX_insertdata`, `digitX_insertnewpass`, `digitX_insertpass` and `digitX_data` are digits for same states as pointers plus state of data showing. 

Output `position_pointer` is a register that is used to show on LED during editing which digit is selected to be increased.

Outputs `digitX` are registers that denote digits that are displaying on LED.

#### How does it work

In the `always` block it checks using the `case` block which digits and position pointer should be showed and put them to the registers of showing data: `digitX` and `position_pointer`.

### state_indicator.v

To show the user which state is now, we will display it on indicators. Manage of indication will be in the `state_indicator` module.

#### Inputs and outputs 

Input `state` is used to select which indicator will be on. It should be connected 

Output `lights` is used to show to the user which state the combinational lock is. It should be connected to light indicators. 

#### How does it work

Module in `always` block turns on the corresponding indicator for the current state and turns off others (note that 0 corresponds to on and 1 â€” to off). The state is checked in `case` block. 

### increase_digit.v

This module increases selected by `position_pointer` digit by one when the user presses the button. Part of number modifying.

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `button_increase` is a control button to increase digit. It should be connected to some button.

Input `position_pointer` shows which digit is selected.

Inputs `state_need` and `state` are used to activate functional when `state` is satisfy `state_need`, and deactivate when not.

Outputs `digitXreg` are registers that contain digits for the module's state.

#### How does it work

Every time when `button_increase` clicked digit corresponding to `position_pointer` increases by one, if `state` satisfy `state_need`. 

### shift_anode.v

This module shifts `position_pointer` by one after clicking `shift_button`. Part of number modifying.

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `shift_button` is control button to shift `position_point`.

Inputs `state_need` and `state` are used to activate functional when `state` is satisfy `state_need`, and deactivate when not.

Output `position_pointer` is a register that denotes the selected digit.

#### How does it work

Every time when `shift_button` clicked position_pointer increases by one, if `state` satisfy `state_need`.

### bcd_to_cathodes.v

Unfortunately, FPGA plate designers didn't implement auto digit to cathode (sticks and points on the LED display) signals translator, we can not just execute some magic command `print` as in Python, so we need to perform translation, as well as other steps to display data, by ourselves.

In the `bcd_to_cathodes` module we perform digit to cathode signals translation of digit data: digit itself (sticks) and, if the current digit is selected, pointer (dot) for it. There happens digit displaying.

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `digit` contains a value to be translated.

Input `position_pointer_now` shows is current digit is selected.

Output `cathode` are registers with translated to cathode signals digit. Current translation work for following order of cathodes cathode[0] -> A, cathode[1] -> B... cathode[7] -> DP (see picture below). Should be connected to cathodes on the FPGA plate.

*7-segment display digit*

#### How does it work

In the first `always` block every time when `position_pointer_now` changes, cathode signal corresponding to point below digit updates respectively. In the second `always` block after every change of `digit` cathode signals corresponding to sticks turns in such a way that displaying the number on LED will be equal to the `digit` value. 

### anode_control.v

Unfortunately (again), the designers of the 7-segment display made not separate pins for the cathodes of each anode, but common to all anodes, apparently for the sake of saving space. Therefore, different numbers cannot be displayed simultaneously on different anodes. But we can do this artificially, displaying the numbers on each anode separately (see the gif animation below), switching between them so quickly that the image on each anode does not have time to fade out. So, we will use this approach in this module.

<img src="https://www.antronics.co.uk/images/4x7seg_slow.gif"/> 
*7-segment display work principle*

In module `anode_control` we sequentially switch on anodes.

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `refreshcounter` is synchronizing iterator which digit is displaying.

Output `anode` is an 8-bit register, where every bit corresponds to on (0) or off (1) of the anode.

#### How does it work

`always` block executes after every iteration of `refreshcounter` and turn on corresponding to iteration anode.

### bcd_control.v

Since we already have an iterational anode activator, we need to implement digit choosing for the current iteration. In the `bcd_control` module we do digit choosing and check if the current digit is selected (for point drawing).

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `state` is used to check if `position_pointer` does make sense to show now. 

Inputs `digitX` are digits which we display. From them we select current.

Input `position_pointer` is the number of digit that is selected.

Input `refreshcounter` is synchronizing iterator which digit is displaying.

Output `ONE_DIGIT` is the value of the current digit.

Output `position_pointer_now` is bool value is current digit is selected.

#### How does it work

In `always` block after every change of iterator `refreshcounter` we update current displaying value `ONE_DIGIT` and `position_pointer_now` (for `position_pointer_now` we additionally check if on this state is "editable", if it is not, so we do not need to show it).

### refresh_counter.v

In the module `refresh_counter` we implement a synchronizing iterator for digits displaying.

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `refresh_clock` is the system clock. In our case, it is a modified clock (later we will see why).

Output `refreshcounter` is an iterator that can have only 8 different values â€” one per digit.

#### How does it work

In `always` block after every clock of `refresh_clock` iterator `refreshcounter` goes to the next digit by increasing by zero (note, that if `refreshcounter` has overflow, it ignores it and drop out overflow part, so after the 8th digit, iterator goes to the 1st digit).

### clock_divider.v

It would seem that all the steps to display a number on the LED display have been completed, and everything should work ... but if we try to display any 8 digits with the existing system, unfortunately, we are faced with a harsh reality, and nothing will work, the numbers on the display will be blurry. The fact is that the standard frequency of 50 MHz is too high, some of the signals on the LED display will not arrive on time. Therefore, we need to lower the clock frequency for the digit display modules.

*Incorrect display of numbers due to too high clock frequency*

In module `clock_divider` we create a new slow clock.

#### Inputs and outputs

Input `clk` is the original clock.

Output `divided_clk` is the slow clock.

#### How does it work

In the module we have parameter `div_value` = 50 MHz / (2 * desired Frequency) - 1. `divided_clk` inverted every (`div_value` + 1)th activation of clock. Thus, frequency of `divided_clk` = 50 MHz /  (2 * (`div_value` + 1)) = 1000 Hz (in our case).

### button_debouncer.v

All the main modules for the operation of the combination lock are ready. However, if we try to run them all together on an FPGA board, we will run into the problem that sometimes a button press is counted as multiple. We don't like this, so we'll make a module `button debouncer`, that will deal with it.

#### Inputs and outputs

We will consider only those inputs and outputs, that we will use. For a detailed description of the module see there: http://www.labfor.ru/articles/debouncer_verilog. 

Input `clk_i` is the system clock.

Input `sw_i` is a button that we want to debounce.

Output `sw_down_o` is a register, that equal to posedge of the button.

#### How does it work

Detailed description of the module see there: http://www.labfor.ru/articles/debouncer_verilog.

### top.v

Finally, we need to implement a top-level module. There we will "call" all modules that we want to use and descript logic between system elements.
